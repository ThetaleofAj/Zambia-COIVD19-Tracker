# Zambia-COVID19-Tracker
ZAMBIA COVID-19 TRACKER is a web app that displays Zambia's COVID-19 stats. It features an interactive chloropeth map of the country, data tables and a graph. All the data used is from the Zambia Ministry of Health daily covid updates. The data is passed to a JavaScript frontend end via an api I built in Python. It's also a progressive web app so you can install it on your device just like a native app.
